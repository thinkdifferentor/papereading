    - Interests of users can be classified into **short term as well as long term interests**.Using Bidirectional LSTMs as an encoder helps us to identify interests which the user has taken up recently (short term) as well the long term interests of the user.
    - For each user, we have the sequence in which news articles were read by her. We then choose the **first R read articles** for each user and use it as inputs to our bidirectional LSTMs.
    - The goal of the **attention mechanism** in such tasksis to derive a context vector that captures relevant source side information to help predict the current target word.In our case, we want to use the sequence of annotations generated by the encoder to come up with a context vector that captures the extent of the user’s interests. 


2. [Dynamic  Attention Deep Model for Article Recommendation by Learning Human Editors’ Demonstration](./deeplearningbasedrecommendation/Dynamic%20%20Attention%20Deep%20Model%20for%20Article%20Recommendation%20by%20Learning%20Human%20Editors%E2%80%99%20Demonstration.pdf)
   - Our data analysis shows that (i) **editors’ selection criteria are non-explicit**, which are less based only on the keywords or topics,but more depend on the quality and atractiveness of the writing from the candidate article, which is hard to capture based on traditional bag-of-words article representation. And (ii) **editors’ article selection behaviors are dynamic**: articles with dierent data distribution come into the pool everyday and the editors’ preference varies, which are driven by some underlying periodic or occasional patterns.
   - To address such problems, we propose a **meta-attention model** across multiple deep neural nets to (i) automatically catch the editors’ underlying selection criteria via the automatic representation learning of each article and its interaction with the meta data and (ii) adaptively capture the change of such criteria via a hybrid attention model. 
   -  convolutional operation and max-pooling technique can be leveraged to capture **the underlying semantic patterns** within the word sequence, which are helpful for the prediction but may not be explicit to be specified. Recent literatures have shown that CNN-based model can achieve promising performance comparative with or even more competitive than other deep models,e.g. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) in many NLP tasks.

3. [Joint Deep Modeling of Users and Items Using Reviews for Recommendation](./deeplearningbasedrecommendation/Joint%20Deep%20Modeling%20of%20Users%20and%20Items%20Using%20Reviews%20for%20Recommendation.pdf)
    - Present a deep model to learn item properties and user behaviors jointly from review text. The proposed model, named Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN), consists of two parallel neural networks coupled in the last layers. One of the networks focuses on learning user behaviors exploiting reviews written by the user, and the other one learns item properties from the reviews written for the item. A shared layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together.
    - DeepCoNN is the first one that jointly models both user and item from reviews using neural networks.(Based on Factorization Machine)
