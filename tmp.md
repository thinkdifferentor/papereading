Transfer learning is able to overcome some of the aforementioned issues by only requiring a small amount of annotated data in the unseen domain; however, it is limited in use due to the lack of pre-trained models developed on a large amount of medical imaging data.s


Domain Adaptation: the assumption of a known target domain requires specific image samples need to be collected (or even labeled) and a new model needs to be retrained before deployment. It is not feasible to obtain a pair of source and target domain images to implement the adversarial domain adaptation for every new application.
