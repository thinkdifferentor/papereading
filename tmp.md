Although some previous works utilized various styles from the wild, e.g., ImageNet for real styles and Painter by Numbers for unreal styles, they overlooked that the high generalization ability comes from learning not only various styles but also various contents. In contrast to previous studies, our main idea is to naturally learn domain-generalized semantic information by leveraging a variety of contents and styles from the wild, without forcing whitening on domain specific styles.
