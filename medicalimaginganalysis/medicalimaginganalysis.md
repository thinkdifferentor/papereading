- **Traits of Medical Imaging:** 
    1. Medical images have multiple modalities and are dense in pixel resolution; 
    2. Medical image data are isolated and acquired in nonstandard settings; 
    3. The disease patterns in medical images are numerous, and their incidence exhibits a long-tailed distribution; 
    4. The labels associated with medical images are sparse and noisy(In fact, the establishment of gold standards for image labeling remains an open issue); 
    5. Medical image processing and analysis tasks are complex and diverse(*reconstruction, enhancement, restoration, classification, detection, segmentation, registration, multimodality*).

- **Key Technologies and Deep Learning:**
    1. **Medical image reconstruction**, which aims to form a visual representation from signals acquired by a medical imaging device, such as a CT or MRI scanner.
    2. **Medical image enhancement**, which aims to adjust the intensities of an image so that the resultant image is more suitable for display or further analysis. (denoising, super resolution, MR bias field correction, image harmonization)
    3. **Medical image segmentation**, which aims to assign labels to pixels so that the pixels with the same label form a segmented object.
    4. **Medical image registration**, which aims to align the spatial coordinates of one or more images into a common coordinate system.
    5. **Computer-aided detection (CADe) and diagnosis (CADx)**: CADe aims to localize or find a bounding box that contains an object (typically a lesion) of interest. CADx aims to further classify the localized lesion as benign/malignant or one of the multiple lesion types.
- **Emerging Deep Learning Approaches:**
    1. **Network Architectures:** 1) Making it deeper: AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ResNet, DenseNet,U-Net; 2) Adversarial and attention mechanisms; 3) Neural architecture search(NAS); 
    2. **Annotation Efficient Approaches:** 1) Transfer Learning; 2) Domain adaptation(A key part of transfer learning); 3) Self-supervised learning; 4) Semisupervised learning; 4) Weakly or partially supervised learning; 5) Unsupervised learning and disentanglement.
    3. **Embedding Knowledge Into Learning** 
    4. **Federated Learning**
    5. **Interpretability:** 1) Model-based interpretability; 2) Posthoc interpretability.
    6. **Uncertainty Quantification**
- In general, most challenges are met by continuous improvement of solutions to the well-known **data challenge**. The community as a whole is continuously developing and improving **TL-based solutions** and **data augmentation schemes**.
- **Multimodality**: One immediate step forward is to **combine the image with additional clinical context**, from patient record to additional clinical descriptors (such as blood tests, genomics, medications, vital signs, and nonimaging data, such as ECG). This step will provide a transition from **image space** to **patient-level** information.
- **Medical Data Collectio**: This step requires building complex infrastructure, along with the generation of new privacy and security regulationsâ€”between hospitals and academic research institutes, across hospitals, and in multinational consortia. As more and more data become available, DL and AI will enable unsupervised explorations within the data, thus providing for new discoveries of drugs and treatments toward the advancement and augmentation of healthcare as we know it.
